# Projetos

This repository has the purpose of showing the projects that I made during my studies. Projects that I consider large enough have their own repositories.

## Games

The folder 'games' has some little games. I didn't use pygame or anything like that, but some of those games have the purpose of training loops and conditional, functions, etc.  

## German

The folder German has was a project that I made for helping people learn the numbers in german. The interface was made using Tkinter and the numbers list  (I didn't write one by one (I'm not crazy) was made using simple for loops.

## JetBrains Academy

This folder is the biggest one. All projects inside, I made by myself (the coding is mine), but the idea behind them  I followed the projects provided by JetBrains Academy. It is a great website, recommend it to all.
